# Intro-to-Python
This is a quick introduction to Python, basic programming, and data science using Jupyter notebooks.

I developed this workshop for the Georgetown University Hoyalytics Club (Graduate).

Each exercise is contained in a Jupyter notebook. These can be downloaded and run using Jupyter locally, or uploaded to Google Colab and run online in a virtual cloud environment.
