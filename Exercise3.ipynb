    "Python code is generally executed line-by-line in a SEQUENTIAL fashion. While this is logical and easy to follow, there are times when we might want to execute different code depending on various conditions--the value of a piece of data, for example. We may also want to perform the same action multiple times--perhaps thousands of times--and it wouldn't make sense to have a line of code for each time we want to do that. Let's examine some basic programming control structures that help us organize and execute our code with these things in mind."
